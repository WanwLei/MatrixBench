ðŸš€ MatrixMul-Bench
A lightweight benchmarking project for testing and comparing matrix multiplication performance across different implementations.
This repository provides examples using plain C/C++/Fortran, CUDA (cuBLAS), and SYCL backends, allowing you to evaluate performance differences on CPU and GPU.

ðŸ”¹ Features:

Standard GEMM performance tests (C = A Ã— B)

FLOPs and execution time measurement

Comparison between hand-written kernels and optimized math libraries

Easy to extend for different hardware and backends
